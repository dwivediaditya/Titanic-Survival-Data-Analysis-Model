# Titanic-Survival-Data-Analysis-Model
## Machine Learning Project : 
Titanic Survival Exploration This project contains create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passengerâ€™s features, such as sex, age, sibsp, embarrked and cabin class which accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data.  You can aso view features of dataset on Kaggle

Goal for this Notebook:
Show a simple example of an analysis of the Titanic disaster in Python. This is aimed for those looking to get into the field or those who are already in the field and looking to see an example of an analysis done with Python.

This Notebook will show basic examples of:
Data Handling
Importing Data with Pandas
Cleaning Data
Exploring Data through Visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn
Data Analysis
Supervised Machine learning Techniques:
K Nearest Neighbour
Gaussian Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Tree Classifier
Plotting results.
